## The Script (Runtime: ~45 Seconds)

### **Introduction**
"Theoretical math can sometimes feel abstract. To demonstrate that this framework is a functional surveillance tool, I will now run a live detection on a randomly generated dataset."

**(Action: Click 'Source')**

### **Beat 1: The Input (While Plot 1 appears)**
First, the system generates a 'Ground Truth' simulation.

What you see here is a population with realistic density variations. I have mathematically suppressed reporting in the center—the red circle—to mimic a conflict zone.

Crucially, I allowed **5% leakage**, meaning a few reports still slip out. To a standard heatmap, this area looks just like the quiet rural background. There is no obvious 'hole' to the naked eye.

### **Beat 2: The Detection (While Plot 2 appears)**
Now, the Topological Detection algorithm runs live.

Unlike density methods that count *how many* cases are nearby, this algorithm measures *how far* one must travel to find a stable cluster.

**(Action: Point to the yellow center)**
As you can see, the algorithm instantly lights up the silenced zone in bright yellow. It has successfully identified the 'Geometric Anomaly'—the void—despite the noise and leakage. This converts the *absence* of data into a *positive signal* for action.

### **Beat 3: The Validation (While Plot 3 appears)**
Finally, a pretty map is not enough; we need statistical rigor.

This plot shows the results of my Monte Carlo Permutation test ($N=999$). The red line represents our observed anomaly score. It falls far outside the blue distribution of random noise.

With a p-value of **0.02**, we can confirm with 95% confidence that this void is a structural feature of the data, not a random fluctuation.

### **Conclusion**
In summary, the tool works instantly, it sees through the noise, and it is statistically robust. I am now happy to take your questions.
